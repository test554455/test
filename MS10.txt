What is microservices?
Ans) Microservices is an architectural style which says decompose big applications into smaller services which are autonomous, self-contained, loosely coupled, independently deployable and each microservice has its own Presentation Layer, Service Layer and Model Layer


Microservices are not invented rather many organizations such as Netflix, Amazon, and eBay successfully used the divide-and-conquer technique to functionally partition their monolithic application into smaller atomic units, each performing a single function.
